# Staged Implementation Plan for Inky Library Refactoring

After analyzing the current Inky library structure and comparing it with the proxy pattern implementations in the DisplayHATMini and UnicornHATMini examples, here's a staged approach to refactoring the Inky library:

## Stage 1: Unified Interface and Platform Detection (Foundation)

**Goals:**
- Create a consistent interface across all implementations
- Implement robust platform detection

**Tasks:**
1. Create an abstract base class `BaseInky` that defines the common interface
2. Refactor platform detection into a dedicated module:
   ```python
   # inky/platform.py
   def is_raspberry_pi():
       """Detect if running on Raspberry Pi hardware"""
       return platform.system() == "Linux" and os.path.exists("/proc/device-tree/model")
   
   def get_implementation_type():
       """Return 'hardware' or 'simulator' based on platform"""
       return "hardware" if is_raspberry_pi() else "simulator"
   ```
3. Update `__init__.py` to make imports more seamless

**Expected Outcome:**
- No change to external API yet
- Foundation for later stages

## Stage 2: Enhanced Mock Implementation (Simulation)

**Goals:**
- Improve the simulator to more accurately match hardware behavior
- Make simulation work across platforms (macOS/Windows/Linux)

**Tasks:**
1. Enhance the current `InkyMock` classes to use pygame instead of tkinter:
   ```python
   # inky/simulator.py (renamed from mock.py)
   class InkySimulator(BaseInky):
       """Pygame-based simulator for Inky displays"""
       # Implementation similar to DisplayHATMini/UnicornHATMini examples
   ```
2. Add proper E-Ink display simulation (slow refresh, partial updates)
3. Implement button simulation via keyboard inputs
4. Ensure the simulator handles all edge cases in the real implementation

**Expected Outcome:**
- Better development experience on non-Pi platforms
- More accurate simulation of E-Ink behavior

## Stage 3: Seamless Implementation Switching (Integration)

**Goals:**
- Allow automatic selection of correct implementation
- Make switching completely transparent to application code

**Tasks:**
1. Create factory function that handles implementation selection:
   ```python
   # inky/factory.py
   def create_inky(display_type, color, **kwargs):
       """Create appropriate Inky implementation based on platform"""
       if get_implementation_type() == "hardware":
           # Return real hardware implementation
           return create_hardware_inky(display_type, color, **kwargs)
       else:
           # Return simulator implementation
           return create_simulator_inky(display_type, color, **kwargs)
   ```
2. Refactor `auto.py` to use the factory pattern
3. Update all hardware-dependent code to use the platform detection module
4. Add command-line option to force simulator/hardware mode

**Expected Outcome:**
- Zero code changes needed between development and deployment
- Automatic selection of correct implementation

## Stage 4: Development Tools (Enhancement)

**Goals:**
- Add tools that improve the development experience
- Create visual debugging aids specific to E-Ink displays

**Tasks:**
1. Add visual representation of refresh cycles in simulator
2. Implement "fast mode" that bypasses E-Ink timing constraints for rapid testing
3. Add debugging overlays (pixel grid, coordinates, button states)
4. Create event logging for hardware interactions
5. Add performance monitoring tools specific to E-Ink displays

**Expected Outcome:**
- Enhanced development workflow
- Better debugging capabilities

## Stage 5: Documentation and Examples (Adoption)

**Goals:**
- Document the new development workflow
- Provide examples that showcase simulator capabilities

**Tasks:**
1. Update documentation to explain simulator usage
2. Create example applications that work in both environments
3. Add unit tests that leverage the simulator
4. Create tutorial on development workflow (code on laptop, deploy to Pi)
5. Document how to handle platform-specific features

**Expected Outcome:**
- Smooth adoption path for existing projects
- Clear guidelines for new development

## Implementation Challenges and Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Maintain compatibility with existing code
   - Provide migration path for projects using the current mock implementation

2. **Hardware-Specific Features**:
   - Some features like EEPROM may not be simulatable
   - Create appropriate mock behaviors for hardware-specific features

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Ensure simulator doesn't introduce excessive resource usage
   - Handle differences in processing power between Pi and development machines

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Create tests that run on both real hardware and simulator
   - Validate simulator accuracy against real hardware behavior

5. **Extension Points**:
   - Design the refactoring to make future display additions easier
   - Consider pluggable simulation backends (pygame/tkinter/web)

## First Steps to Get Started

1. Create the `BaseInky` abstract base class
2. Implement the platform detection module
3. Build a simple proof-of-concept of the factory pattern
4. Test with a basic application on both Pi and non-Pi environments
